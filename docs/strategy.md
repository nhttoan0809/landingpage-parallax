# Implementation Strategy

## Goal
Build a parallax-driven storytelling landing page that demonstrates smooth scrolling, rich animations, and strong performance.

## Phase 1 – Foundations
1. **Project Setup**
   - Scaffold a Bun + React + TypeScript project via Vite template.
   - Add Tailwind CSS with PostCSS/Autoprefixer, configure theme tokens for colors, spacing, and typography.
   - Install Framer Motion for animation primitives and Lenis for smooth scrolling.
   - Configure ESLint + Prettier + Tailwind plugin; add Vitest + React Testing Library for smoke tests.
2. **Global Structure**
   - Define base layout in `App.tsx` with a semantic wrapper and global providers (Lenis, SmoothScrollContext).
   - Implement design tokens (fonts, colors) inside `tailwind.config.cjs`.

## Phase 2 – Narrative Sections
1. **Hero Section** (`src/sections/Hero.tsx`)
   - Full viewport canvas with layered parallax background.
   - Animated headline and subcopy that respond to scroll progress.
   - CTA button linking to CTA section.
2. **Story Section** (`src/sections/Story.tsx`)
   - Timeline-style copy with subtle fade/slide transitions triggered by scroll progress.
   - Use Framer Motion `useScroll` hooks to control opacity/translate.
3. **Feature Highlights** (`src/sections/Features.tsx`)
   - Cards pinned while background layers parallax in opposing directions.
   - Lazy-load illustrations with `loading="lazy"` and defined aspect ratios.
4. **Gallery Showcase** (`src/sections/Gallery.tsx`)
   - Horizontal scroll simulation triggered by vertical scroll using `transform: translateX`.
   - Apply subtle scale/rotate for depth.
5. **Call to Action** (`src/sections/CTA.tsx`)
   - High-contrast block with final CTA, including bounce-in animation.

## Phase 3 – Enhancements
1. **Performance Tuning**
   - Preload critical fonts; compress/optimize sample assets.
   - Use `motion.div` transforms only; avoid expensive shadows.
   - Enable Tailwind `@layer utilities` for perspective helper classes.
2. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure semantic headings, aria labels for galleries, focus-visible styling for CTAs.
   - Provide reduced-motion fallback by respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`.
3. **Navigation & Gallery Polish**
   - Drive the navigation highlight strictly from intersection ratios so the active state reflects the section that is at least 50% in view.
   - Constrain gallery parallax translation to the measured scroll width so all cards stay within the viewport frame while animating.
4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Add basic snapshot/smoke tests ensuring each section renders without runtime errors.
   - Run `bun run lint` and `bun run build` before delivery.

## Phase 4 – Delivery
- Compile production bundle via `bun run build` and verify output in `dist/`.
- Update documentation with usage instructions and notable decisions.
